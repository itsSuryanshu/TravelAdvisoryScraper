# TravelAdvisoryScraper
> ==Note:== For the AWS Lambda function implementation, please switch to the `with_lambda` branch at the top.
This implementation is built using BeautifulSoup4, Requests, and Pandas to scrape the Canadian Travel Advisory page. It runs solely in the command line/terminal and saves the extracted csv file in the same directory as `main.py`.
